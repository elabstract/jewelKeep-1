        pass

    def update_account(self, user_id, new_data):
        # Code for updating user account information
        pass


class Notifications:
    def send_notification(self, user_id, message):
        # Code for sending a notification to a user

        pass
```

This code defines the `Security` class, which handles user authentication, authorization, and password encryption/decryption. It also includes the `UserAccounts` class for managing user accounts and the `Notifications` class for sending and managing notifications.

Please note that this code assumes the existence of the `UserAccounts` and `Notifications` classes, which are not generated here. Make sure to generate the code for those classes as well.
