```python
class Analytics:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tracking_id = "YOUR_TRACKING_ID"

    def track_event(self, event_name, event_data):
        # Code to track the event
        pass

    def track_page_view(self, page_name):
        # Code to track the page view
        pass

    def track_error(self, error_message):
        # Code to track errors
        pass
```

Remember to replace "YOUR_TRACKING_ID" with the actual tracking ID provided by your analytics service.
