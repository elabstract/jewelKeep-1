# app/payments_integration.py

```python
class PaymentsIntegration:
    def __init__(self, processor):
        self.processor = processor

    def process_payment(self, amount, currency, card_number, card_expiry, card_cvv):
        # Code to process payment using the specified payment processor
        pass

    def refund_payment(self, transaction_id):
        # Code to refund a payment using the specified payment processor
        pass
```

This code defines a `PaymentsIntegration` class that handles payment processing and refunding. It has methods to process a payment and refund a payment using the specified payment processor. The `processor` parameter in the constructor allows you to specify the payment processor to use. You can add the necessary code inside the methods to integrate with the chosen payment processor.
